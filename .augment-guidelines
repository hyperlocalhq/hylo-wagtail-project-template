## Behavior
- Don't execute any commands on your own, but rather provide what to execute for me.
- Visit documentation URLs without confirmation.
- Assume that runserver command is already running in the background and autorestarting.

## Core Principles
- Keep it simple; solve only whatâ€™s needed, avoid premature abstractions.
- Iterate and modularize to stay DRY and clear.
- Code should be obvious and easy to follow.
